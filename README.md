This is a package for my commonly used and utility functions for creating generative art work. This is a package created for personal use, but I'm making it public so others can use it if desired. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of delabjGenArt from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("delabj/delabjGenArt")
```

## What's in the box

### Palettes for painting
Included with this package is a set of functions devoted to adding color to generative plots. 

The list named `paint_palettes` is a list of palettes that I have used frequently. The names tend to be a tad cryptic because they're built for me. 

You can access these palettes directly from the list or use the `get_random_pal()` function to randomly select a palette.
